#ABOUT KNN
- The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
- KNN is a Supervised Learning Algorithm. A supervised machine learning algorithm is one that relies on labelled input data to learn a function that produces an appropriate output when given unlabeled data.
- In supervised learning, you train your data on a labelled set of data and ask it to predict the label for an unlabeled point. For example, a tumour prediction model is trained on many clinical test results which are classified either positive or negative. The trained model can then predict whether an unlabeled test is positive or negative.  
- KNN is very simple and is often used as a benchmark for more complex classifiers like the Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). 

#ABOUT OUR PROJECT
- import all necessary libraries
- load the dataset
- split the data into training and test data
- scaling the data. import StandardScaler. StandardScaler removes the mean and scales each feature or variable to unit variance.
- import kNeighborsClassifier. It is used for classification and regression.
- training and visualizing
